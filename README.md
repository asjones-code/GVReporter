Gun Violence Reporter 
Adam Jones, 2020

This application is designed to quickly calculate data regarding gun crime. All data used is from the Gun Violence Archive (https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/). The motivation behind this app was to provide some personal practice in Python as well as understand patterns of gun violence in my hometown, NYC. Fortunately, the technologies used in this app can easily be modified for other uses. The core functionality of this app are to scrape a website, navigate to a specific URL, generate and download a CSV for manipulation in Pandas. By combining Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and CloudFlare Scraper, this task wasn't too difficult.
